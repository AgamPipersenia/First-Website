                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  <br>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a second year undergraduate in the department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Kanpur. I am highly interested in the fields of algorithmic trading and robotics.
                  I am also interested in web development as it allows individuals to express their creativity through designing and building visually appealing websites. It involves creating layouts, selecting color schemes, choosing typography, and organizing content in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  In my spare time, I enjoy watching football. I also like to badminton with my friends.
                  I believe that these activities fuel my creativity and help me bring a
                  unique perspective to my work.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch with me if you have
                  any questions. I am excited to collaborate and
                  contribute to your success!
