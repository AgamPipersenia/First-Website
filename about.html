                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  <br>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently a sophomore at IIT Kanpur in the department of Aerospace Engineering.
                  I have a deep-rooted passion for the worlds of Finance and Programming, fueled by an insatiable curiosity that perpetually drives me to explore, learn, and immerse myself in the ever-evolving landscape of these fields. This unquenchable thirst for knowledge is the very essence of what keeps me ardently engaged in the pursuit of new horizons.

                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  In my spare time, I enjoy watching football. Ocassionally, I play badminton with my friends.
                  I believe that these activities help fuel my creativity and help me bring a
                  unique perspective to my work.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutcontent">
                  Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch with me if you have
                  any questions. I am excited to collaborate and
                  contribute to your success!
